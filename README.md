# Metronome

Metronome is a (would be) cross-platform kivy and kivymd metronome that lets you search for a song's bpm through the spotify API and immediately play it.

# Motivation

I noticed that sometimes when i hear song, i immediately want find out its bpm and see if i can keep up.

This app provides an easier way to do it that googling the bpm and opening a metronome.

# Name

Naming suggestions are welcome, i honestly have no idea what to call this.
