## From source
You need to have spotify client credentials - client id and client secret.

Follow [this guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/) to get client credentials.

Edit `config.cfg` with your credentials.

Afterwards, follow platform-specific instructions:

### For computer
Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To use, run main.py from the main project folder.
### For android

*Note: the metronome feature might not function correctly*

*Optional: make a virtual env for building named build*

Build it yourself using buildozer(only available for linux):

install buildozer and dependencies.

move buildozer.spec from android folder to main folder.

Run  `buildozer android debug deploy` from terminal in main project directory.
